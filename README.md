# pokeemerald Expansion
This branch adds music from the Generation IV Pokémon games to the Pokeemerald decompilations. It is recommended that your repository is up to date as long as this branch is too. Feel free to use the voice groups to make your own music. (Soundfonts available in the voicegroups folder!)

This branch also implements Ipatix's HQ m4a mixer and *15 voice direct sound polyphony*.

# Pokémon Emerald

## What is the pokeemerald Expansion?

The pokeemerald Expansion is a collection of feature branches that can be integrated into existing [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) projects.

## What feature branches are included?

- **[Battle Engine Upgrade](../tree/battle_engine):** Upgrades the battle engine in pokeemerald to newer Generation games' standards. It also adds newer moves and abilities.
- **[Pokémon Expansion](../tree/pokemon_expansion):** Adds Pokémon from newer Generations and makes them available in the National Dex. It also updates base stats and other Pokémon info.
- **[Item Expansion](../tree/item_expansion):** Adds items from newer Generations and also updates item effects for field use.
- **[master](../tree/master):** Combines the above branches into one single branch for the sake of convenience. Note that this branch is only updated once in a while, so you must merge manually if you want the latest features.

## Who maintains the project?

The project was originally started by DizzyEgg alongside other contributors.

The project has now gotten larger and DizzyEgg is now maintaining the project as part of the ROM Hacking Hideout community. Some members of this community are taking on larger roles to help maintain the project.

## Can I contribute even if I'm not a member of ROM Hacking Hideout?

Yes! Contributions are welcome via Pull Requests and they will be reviewed by maintainers. Please note that PRs to master are not accepted, as master is only intended to be a merged branch.

## What is ROM Hacking Hideout?

A Discord-based ROM hacking community that has many members who hack using the disassembly and decompilation projects for Pokémon. Quite a few contributors to the original feature branches by DizzyEgg were members of ROM Hacking Hideout. You can call it RHH for short!
